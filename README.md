# Python Fundamentals

This repository contains small Python programs created to practice
core programming concepts such as:

- Variables and data types
- Loops and conditionals
- Functions
- Error handling (try/except)
- Basic algorithmic thinking

The goal of this repository is to show my learning process
and problem-solving approach using Python.
